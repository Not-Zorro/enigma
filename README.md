# Enigma
### Functionality
Functionality wise I have cracking fully implemented into my project with command line enabled. Functionality-wise I would be giving myself a 4.
### Object-oriented programming
Excluding the crack method I would give myself a 4. Everything is broken down into logical components. and no method exceeds 8 lines of code. No class is more than 100 lines and no line length is longer than 80 characters. If the crack method is included I would give myself a 3 because some methods break those rules.
### Test Driven Development
For TDD I would give myself a 4 because of SimpleCov having a 100% coverage as well as a few of my tests introduce mocks and stubs and all tests have correct naming.
### Version Control
For version control I would give myself a 3 because I did not document or communicate the purpose of the pull request and document it correctly although the rest of my criteria meet level 4 expectations.
